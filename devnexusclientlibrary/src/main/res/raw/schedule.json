It’s a nice logic next step from functional programming. It takes the concept of function composition and lazy evaluations to the next level. It streamlines handling of many critical issues that are architectural in nature: resilience, scale, responsiveness, and messaging.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, we will start with a quick introduction to reactive programming. We will then dive into code examples and learn how to create reactive applications. We’ll learn to implement observables, to deal with errors in a graceful manner, learn both synchronous and asynchronous solutions, hot vs. cold observables, and dealing with backpressures.","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":1009,"createdDate":null,"updatedDate":1448908887888,"version":9,"bio":"Dr. Venkat Subramaniam is an award-winning author, founder of Agile Developer, Inc., and an instructional professor at the University of Houston.\r\n\r\nHe has trained and mentored thousands of software developers in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia, and is a regularly-invited speaker at several international conferences.

But, let’s imagine prototyping our own low-powered devices. What if we could end up with something smaller than a stack of quarters and a battery life of at least one week? Prototyping these kinds of devices used to be something that required specialized skills in electrical and mechanical engineering, as well as embedded development. Today, thanks to the maker revolution, we can combine our deep knowledge of programming with basic electronics and soldering skills and access to a 3-D printer to create useful devices. More importantly, there are already some boards on the market that give iOS and Android developers the ability to interact with them without needing to create custom Bluetooth drivers or write C++ firmware.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll take a quick tour of some of these options and then do a deep dive into creating a wearable prototype using the MbientLab MetaWear board, a Bluetooth beacon, and native Android or iOS code. This will be a hands-on session that’ll teach you how to connect to the board, access its sensors, and store data for offline tracking. We’ll also introduce beacons and experiment with cloud storage as we build a real application. All of this will build up to the final exercise in which the entire class will build and play a multiplayer game of IoT Tag!\r\n\r\nFor this class you will need:\r\n- Android Developer Studio or Xcode (with an active Apple Developer Account)\r\n- A device that supports Bluetooth LE 4.0 (Android 4.4 or greater or iPhone 4S or greater)\r\n- Some experience with Android or iOS development (Enough to be able to import a project, build it, and install it on a phone, along with a strong understanding of mobile app development.)\r\n\r\nThings we will cover:\r\n- An overview of the current wearable maker options such as Arduino, etc.\r\n- A basic overview of power limitations, Bluetooth LE, etc.\r\n- The basics of the MetaWear board.\r\n- Creating services to connect/interact with MetaWear.\r\n- Reading data from the device.\r\n- Using onboard sensors.\r\n- Event logging.\r\n- Offline logic with macros.\r\n- Ranging and BLE beacon basics (Eddystone and iBeacon)\r\n\r\nMetaWear devices will be made available for the session.

We are confronted with an onslaught of public cloud providers; which one should we choose? Are we ready for public cloud? Or do we need to focus on private cloud? And what does that even mean? Or are we looking for a hybrid solution? And these questions are only the beginning. Soon we’ll be looking at IaaS vs. PaaS. Containers vs. Unikernels. Servers vs. Serverless! Is there any way to make sense of all of the choices and cut through all of the hype?\r\n\r\nFortunately there is a way forward. There are clear architectural concepts and patterns that we can use as guideposts on our journey to the cloud. In this full-day workshop, we’ll gain an understanding of the unique characteristics of cloud infrastructure and how we can design and develop application architectures that fully exploit those unique characteristics. These \"cloud native\" architectures compose simple patterns with predictable performance, scaling, security and failure characteristics to create solutions to complex problems that can be quickly, flexibly, and continuously evolved to take advantage of new information. In many ways these architectures have more in common with organic systems than anything we’ve previously called software.\r\n\r\nThese characteristics of cloud native architectures allow us to practice an extreme flavor of continuous delivery that allows us to survive a new marketplace where speed is our primary competitive advantage and access to consumer services must be ubiquitous. \r\n\r\nThe newly trained cloud architect will leave this workshop equipped with an understanding of:\r\n\r\n* unique characteristics of cloud infrastructure\r\n* architecture concepts unique to cloud native \r\n* significant tradeoffs involved in cloud architecture\r\n* the concept of continuous partial failure and how it affects architecture\r\n* the importance of composability to cloud architectures\r\n* how continuous delivery, devops, and microservices relate to cloud\r\n\r\nYou’ll also leave with a rich catalog of cloud native architecture patterns that you should be able to apply regardless of your choice of cloud provider or technology stack.","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":1404,"createdDate":null,"updatedDate":1479431021051,"version":10,"bio":"Matt Stine is a 17 year veteran of the enterprise IT industry, with eight of those years spent as a consulting solutions architect for multiple Fortune 500 companies, as well as the not-for-profit [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org).

Velocity is simply a measurement of speed in a given direction; the rate at which a team is delivering toward a product release.

However, that assumption is dangerous because it ignores the risks with higher speeds.

But then microservices showed that if architects build evolvability into the architecture, change becomes easier. This talk, based on my upcoming book, investigates the family of software architectures that support evolutionary change, along with how to build evolvable systems. Understanding how to evolve architecture requires understanding how architectural dimensions interact; I describe how to achieve appropriate coupling between components and services. Incremental change is critical for the mechanics of evolution; I cover how to build engineering and DevOps practices to support continuous change. Uncontrolled evolution leads to undesirable side effects; I cover how fitness functions build protective, testable scaffolding around critical parts to guide the architecture as it evolves.\r\n\r\nThe software development ecosystem exists in a state of dynamic equilibrium, where any new tool, framework, or technique leads to disruption and the establishment of a new equilibrium. Predictability is impossible when the foundation architects plan against changes constantly in unexpected ways. Instead, prefer evolvability over predictability. This talk illustrates how to achieve evolutionary architectures and how to retrofit existing systems to support better evolution.\r\n\r\n","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":1006,"createdDate":null,"updatedDate":1479370676990,"version":11,"bio":"Neal is Director, Software Architect, and Meme Wrangler\r\nat ThoughtWorks, a software company and a community of\r\npassionate, purpose-led individuals, who thinks disruptively to\r\ndeliver technology to address the toughest challenges, all while\r\nseeking to revolutionize the IT industry and create positive social\r\nchange.

To do this, we need to build independent, autonomous services which by definition tend to minimize dependencies on other systems. One of the tenants of microservices, and a way to minimize dependencies,  is \"a service should own its own database\". Unfortunately this is a lot easier said than done. Why? Because: your data.\r\n\r\nWe've been dealing with data in information systems for 5 decades so isn't this a solved problem? Yes and no. A lot of the lessons learned are still very relevant. Traditionally, we application developers have accepted the practice of using relational databases and relying on all of their safety guarantees without question. But as we build services architectures that span more than one database (by design, as with microservices), things get harder. If data about a customer changes in one database, how do we reconcile that with other databases (especially where the data storage may be heterogenous?).\r\n\r\nFor developers focused on the traditional enterprise, not only do we have to try to build fast-changing systems that are surrounded by legacy systems, the domains (finance, insurance, retail, etc) are incredibly complicated. Just copying with Netflix does for microservices may or may not be useful. So how do we develop and reason about the boundaries in our system to reduce complexity in the domain?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore these problems and see how Domain Driven Design helps grapple with the domain complexity. We'll see how DDD concepts like Entities and Aggregates help reason about boundaries based on use cases and how transactions are affected. Once we can identify our transactional boundaries we can more carefully adjust our needs from the CAP theorem to scale out and achieve truly autonomous systems with strictly ordered eventual consistency. We'll see how technologies like Apache Kafka, Apache Camel and Debezium.io can help build the backbone for these types of systems. We'll even explore the details of a working example that brings all of this together.","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":4223,"createdDate":1417279088540,"updatedDate":1479375765201,"version":5,"bio":"Christian Posta (@christianposta) is a Principal Middleware Specialist/Architect at Red Hat and well known for being an author, frequent blogger, speaker, and open-source enthusiast.

Enterprise level concerns and the importance of holistic governance, operational management, and a Metadata Lake will be conceptually investigated.  The next level of detail will be to explore what a prospective architecture looks like at scale with Terabytes of ingestion per day, how scale puts pressure on an architecture, and how to be successful without losing data in a mission critical system via resilient, self-healing, scalable technologies.  DevOps and application architecture concerns will be first-class themes throughout.\r\n \r\nReactive principles and technology will be the second act of this talk.  Kafka.  Akka.  Spark.  Various streaming technologies (Kafka Streams, Akka Streams, Spark Streaming) will be reviewed to identify what they are best suited for.  The fast data pipeline discussion will center around Kafka, Akka, and Apache Flink (Lightbend Fast Data platform).  We'll also walk through an exciting addition to the Akka family, Alpakka, which is a Camel equivalent for Enterprise Integration Patterns.\r\n \r\nThe final act will be to dive into the Data Lake, from both an analytics and application development perspective.  Technologies used to explain concepts will include Amazon and Hadoop.  A Data Lake may service multiple analytics consumers with various \"views\" (and access levels) of data.  It may also be a participant of various applications, perhaps by acting as a centralized source for reference data or common middleware (in turn feeding the analytics aspect).  The concept of the Metadata Lake to apply structure, meaning and purpose will be an over-arching success factor for a Data Lake.  The difference between the Data Lake and Metadata Lake is conceptually similar to a Halocline...  Various technologies (Iglu/Snowplow and more) will be discussed from a feature standpoint to flesh out the technology capabilities needed for Data Lake governance.\r\n \r\nExpect an extremely dense, content rich experience; akin to my previous presentations about Docker, Microservices/APIs and development methodology.\r\n","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":4675,"createdDate":1419613507341,"updatedDate":1479849875645,"version":3,"bio":"Todd leads software development teams to design and implement innovative, enterprise-class, secure, distributed, mission-critical systems via effective alignment of technology (and development process) to business needs.

In this talk you will learn how aggregates enable you to develop business logic for the modern world of microservices and NoSQL. We will describe how to use aggregates to design modular business logic that can be partitioned into microservices. You will learn how aggregates enable you to use eventual consistency  instead of ACID.

This talk will show you how to use [Clojure](http://clojure.org) and the new [spec](http://clojure.org/about/spec) library to write programs that behave as expected, meet operational requirements, and have the flexibility to accommodate change.\r\n\r\nWith Clojure, you can rapidly develop robust and reusable programs using\r\n\r\n- [interactive development](http://clojure.org/about/dynamic) at the REPL\r\n- [immutable data and pure functions](http://clojure.org/about/functional_programming)\r\n- [code as data](http://clojure.org/about/lisp)\r\n\r\nClojure's new spec library augments these approaches. Developing with spec is *declarative*, *predicative*, *layered*, *robust*, and *integrated* with Clojure.\r\n\r\nspec is *declarative*. As with type systems in static languages, spec lets you make declarative statements that communicate and document data, function arguments, and returns.\r\n\r\nspec is *predicative*. You can declare predicates about data, about function arguments and returns, and even function semantics. This overlaps not only with type systems, but also with validations that are often done with costly bespoke tests and runtime checks.\r\n\r\nspec is *layered*. Spec does not require any specific workflow or program shape, and in particular is compatible with iterative and incremental development.\r\n\r\nspec supports *robust* programs via automatic generative testing. Given specifications, spec can write [generative tests](https://github.com/clojure/test.check) for you, generating a volume of tests limited only by your CPU time, not by what you are able to write and maintain by hand.\r\n\r\nspec is fully *integrated* with Clojure.

Let’s talk about what mentoring is, what it is not, and what makes for an effective mentorship. ​\r\n\r\nThere is an ongoing mantra within the developer community: that there are far more jobs available then programmers to fill them. Which should be an indication as to the wonderful potential for both business and those learning to code. Yet what often follows such statements are not words of joy but rather a list of frustrations related to the difficulty in finding and retaining enough skilled developers to fill these positions. \r\nThe challenge is not in the number of newbies entering the field but the number who leave because they are not able to bridge the divide between bootcamps, online tutorials, books, videos, etc. to an employable developer who is able to contribute to the team. \r\n\r\nKim has years of experience working with learners of various ages in helping them develop the skills they needed to be successful at whatever their chosen goal. She understands that for businesses to be successful, they must develop more effective and efficient ways of recruiting and retaining developers in order to meet organizational benchmarks. \r\nThe developer community is a overwhelmingly generous one and a well designed mentoring or apprenticeship program could be one answer that business leaders and newbies are looking for.\r\n\r\n- The business costs associated with corporate hiring managers inability to recruit and retain skilled workers to fill current and future entry-level positions are increasing (Queen, 2014). \r\n- 89 percent of organizational leaders stated that they are having difficulties filling open positions, which is causing them to either turn down orders, miss key deliverable deadlines or hire individuals from outside of the United States (Aho, 2015). \r\n\r\nAho, K.

In the beginning, it was managed with callbacks, which unfortunately led to callback hell. Next, came Promises, which untangled the nested callbacks and yielded powerful mapping constructs over eventual values. However, even with Promises, it was difficult to express meaningful, readable control flow and manage errors. While these patterns are still useful, their limitations have become apparent. In this talk, explore two newer patterns for managing asynchronous code with more meaningful semantics. First, learn about async functions, which will land in the ES2017 spec of JavaScript. Async functions allow asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous manner and are already natively available in some browsers. Investigate several use cases and \"gotchas\" of async functions and learn how they work with Promises. Next, discover Observables via RxJS and how they provide a more powerful construct for operating on eventual values similar to Promises. Observables offer a more robust and meaningful API compared to Promises and can easily work with various event sources such as DOM events, WebSockets, and REST API's. Leave this talk with better confidence and ability to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript.","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":17434,"createdDate":1479416947813,"updatedDate":1479674567271,"version":1,"bio":"Jeremy Fairbank is a remote web developer in Tennessee.
