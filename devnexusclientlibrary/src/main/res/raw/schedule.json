As an industry we do have the Unified Modeling Language (UML), yet many people favour informal boxes and lines sketches instead. The problem is that such diagrams rarely make any sense, usually need a narrative to accompany them and ultimately slow the team down. Although we can argue whether UML offers an effective way to communicate software architecture, that's often irrelevant because many teams have already thrown out UML or simply don't know it. Abandoning UML is one thing but, in the race for agility, many software development teams have lost the ability to communicate visually too.\r\n\r\nThis hands-on session is aimed at those involved in the software development process and is about improving communication.

As the web quickly evolved, we watched web applications become smarter and more robust, taking advantage of dynamically served content and programming languages on the server.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, a web application would be the only interface into your infrastructure. Your customers would interact with the application and it would make full page requests at every turn. We eventually started sprinkling in ajax calls, but at the core, the architecture of a web app hadn’t changed much. When mobile devices became commonplace, the interface landscape changed a bit. We created the need for supporting a new client that had to interface with our primary web application.\r\n\r\nNow that we have client frameworks like Ember, we can start separating our concerns and treating our web applications as interfaces independent of their backend. On the flip side, we have started evolving the backend of our web apps into agnostic APIs and services that serve any type of interface, be it web, mobile, or the next big platform.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll show you how we do just that at Heroku.

The most recent label for this concept is \"application self-protection\". \r\n\r\nThere are many security protections available to applications today. AppSensor builds on these by providing a mechanism that allows architects and developers to build into their applications a way to detect events and attacks, then automatically respond to them. Not only can this stop and/or reduce the impact of an attack, it gives you incredibly valuable visibility and security intelligence about the operational state of your applications. \r\n\r\nThe self-protection model benefits all types of applications. In particular, it has gained traction with developers operating in the cloud and on DevOps teams. The increased visibility and speed of response become critical at scale.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we'll discuss what AppSensor is and what it can offer you. The current feature set will be covered along with upcoming features from the roadmap. In addition, you will learn how to cover different use cases with AppSensor by a walk-through of some sample applications. Lastly, you will receive information about the different components and integrations that make AppSensor enterprise-friendly.\r\n\r\nTake-aways you will have from this presentation are:\r\n\r\n* Knowledge about the benefits of proactive application self-protection\r\n* Information of the features in the open-source reference implementation\r\n* Guidance on implementing AppSensor in the real world\r\n* Pointers to supporting materials specifically created for developers, architects, and senior management.\r\n","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":6433,"createdDate":1447803643141,"updatedDate":1448905382286,"version":1,"bio":"John is the lead developer on the OWASP AppSensor project.

This trend is horizontal  and covers operating system packages, language libraries and application modules (plugins).\r\nBut while some module systems are nicer to use, others are repeating past mistakes and are a daily source for developer agony and pain.\r\nIn this keynote I will present the \"lessons learned\" at JFrog, where we make software for managing software libraries and deal with many types of module systems. This talk will show what works and what doesn't work in a module system; what features can make a module ecosystem thrive or fail; and why, despite all downsides, modules are here to stay and conquer more space as the Cloud continues to grow.","presentationLink":"","speakers":[{"id":2236,"createdDate":1389052287494,"updatedDate":1448770684312,"version":6,"bio":"JavaOne Rockstar Baruch Sadogursky (a.k.a JBaruch) is the Developer Advocate of JFrog, the creators of Artifactory Binary Repository, the home of Bintray, JavaOne 2011 and 2013 Duke Choice Awards winner.\r\n\r\nFor a living he hangs out with the JFrog tech leaders, writes some code around Artifactory and Bintray, and then speaks and blogs about all that.

Primarily because it provides significant benefits in terms of conciseness, readability and safety, without some of the drawbacks that adopting a new language has such as a higher learning curve or interoperability with existing code and ecosystems.

They make it easy to develop data-processing Spring Boot applications that build upon the capabilities of Spring Integration and Spring Batch, respectively. At a higher level of abstraction, Spring Cloud Data Flow is an integrated orchestration layer that provides a highly productive experience for deploying and managing sophisticated data pipelines consisting of standalone microservices. Streams and tasks are defined using a DSL abstraction and can be managed via shell and a web UI. Furthermore, a pluggable runtime SPI allows Spring Cloud Data Flow to coordinate these applications across a variety of distributed runtime platforms such as Apache YARN, Cloud Foundry, or Apache Mesos. This session will provide an overview of these projects, including how they evolved out of Spring XD.

I was team lead with full control of our green-field project.  After a year, we had continuous delivery, a beautiful clean code base, and worked directly with our customers to design the features.  Then our company split in two, we were moved under different management, and I watched my project get crushed. \r\n\r\nAs a consultant, I saw the same pattern of relentless business pressure everywhere, driving one project after another into the ground.  I made it my mission to help the development teams solve this problem.  This is my story of lessons learned on how to transform an organization from the bottom up.   I'll show you how to lead the way.\r\n\r\n**Warning:** This strategy won't work in all organizations.  In some cases, management doesn't want to know the truth.  However, in most organizations I've worked with, management wants to improve, but doesn't know how to fix the system. \r\n\r\nThe crushing business pressure is caused by a broken feedback loop that's baked into the organization's design.  In this presentation, I'll show you how to fix the broken feedback loop.  Learn how to:\r\n\r\n* Gather evidence of developer productivity loss\r\n* Identify the key organizational changes required for success\r\n* Make the case to management for improvement\r\n* Partner with your manager for long-term success\r\n\r\nIf the system is broken, we need to fix the system.
